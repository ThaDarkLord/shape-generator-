# shape-generator-

## Description

This project was created so that I could practice writing code that can be tested and learn different ways to utilize class constructors. I also had to spend sometime working with |SVG files and learning how to add them into my code. I found it most difficult to write tests for this application and will spend more time practicing in that area.


## Usage

This application allows the user to answer questions in order to create one of three shapes that will include initials and different colors for text and background. Once the user answers all the questions a file will be written with their personal logo.
